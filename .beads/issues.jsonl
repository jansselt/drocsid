{"id":"drocsid-aix","title":"Fix LiveKit voice/video - container crash loop","description":"LiveKit container panics on startup with 'invalid argument to Intn' in getNAT1to1IPsForConf when use_external_ip is true. STUN auto-detection fails even with explicit stun servers and host networking. The container is in a crash loop on lighthouse (192.168.50.10).\n\nSetup: Docker with network_mode: host, config file at docker/livekit.yaml, keys via LIVEKIT_KEYS env var. Signaling proxied through Cloudflare Tunnel via nginx /livekit/ location. Media ports (7881 TCP, 7882 UDP) port-forwarded on router.\n\nAttempted fixes that didn't work:\n1. Switched from Docker bridge to host networking\n2. Added explicit STUN servers (stun.l.google.com:19302)\n3. Set use_external_ip: false with --node-ip from env var (not fully tested)\n\nKey files: docker/docker-compose.prod.yml, docker/livekit.yaml, deploy/nginx/drocsid.conf\n\nThe root issue is that STUN doesn't work from this network/server. Need to figure out why, or find a reliable alternative for providing the public IP to LiveKit ICE candidates.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"jansselt@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T15:15:30.810280629-06:00","created_by":"Luke Janssen","updated_at":"2026-02-13T16:44:48.053199141-06:00"}
