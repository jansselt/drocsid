The code block area appears but the content inside is invisible/missing\n\n**Expected:** Content between triple backticks should render in a code block.\n\n**Possibly related:** The Markdown tokenizer regex for code blocks is ```(\\w*)\\n?([\\s\\S]*?)``` — it requires either a newline or content immediately after the opening backticks. If the user types the opening/closing backticks on the same line without a newline (e.g. ```test```), the (\\w*) capture group may consume 'test' as the language identifier, leaving nothing for the content capture group.
